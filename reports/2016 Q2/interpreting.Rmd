## Interpreting the metrics

There are three sections for each metric:

 - __Benchmark plot__  Each plot shows the rolling 12 month average rate for your program, the overall GAMUT rate and the distribution of the other participants. 
 - __Run chart__ Each plot shows a line graph of the reported metric data by month. Only generated if there are at least 6 data points. 
 - __Data table__ Monthly raw data used to calculate the benchmark plots and run charts.

Benchmark plots show your program compared to other GAMUT participants.  The blue dot and horizontal bar represents your program rate and the 95\% confidence interval. The vertical dashed line shows the overall combined rate across all GAMUT participants. When the blue horizontal bar crosses the vertical line, this indicates that your program rate is not significantly different than the overall rate. The black dots indicate the estimated rate for each GAMUT participant that submitted data. Only programs that submitted a total of at least 5 cases in the metric denominator for the year are included in the graphs.

Run charts include all data that has been submitted, which may be more than 12 months. The dots represent the monthly average values for that metric. The center line (CL) is the median of the values, so half of the data points are above the median and half are below. A dashed yellow line indicates that there is non-random pattern, which may be due to improvement initiatives or degredation of the process. Non-random patterns include 6 or more points on either side of the median, or fewer crossings of the median line than expected. Ideally, there should be at least 12 points in a run chart to be useful. 

In the example above, there is a increase in the percentage, which may be the result of a process improvement initiative or some other cause. 


The Quality Improvement Hub by NHS Scotland is a great resource with additional details on how to interpret Run Charts:

![Example data table](figures/examples/example_datatable.png) 

Data tables show the individual numerators, denominators and calculated rates by month for the 12 month benchmark reporting period. Months with missing or invalid calculations are shown as 'NA' or 'NaN'.
