\begin{abstract}
This demonstration report is based on incomplete data for the year. In each of the graphs that follow, the vertical line shows the overall combined rate for all progams. The dots reflect the rate for each program and the horizontal bars indicate the 95\% confidence interval. When the horizontal bar does not cross the vertical line, this indicates that program's rate is significantly higher or lower than the overall rate.\\

\section{Introduction}
This report is designed to give representation of a high-level cumulative overview of the individual institutional performance related to the included quality metrics.  As we`ve discussed, quality improvement run charts will be included in a separate report and are designed to present performance over time which is the optimal way to monitor these quality data on a continual basis.\\

Included in this report are the 12 national consensus metrics.  Reports for the remaining Ohio Collaborative metrics will be generated separately.  You`ll notice that there are some areas where we suspect that the detection of events is not sensitive (ex. medication administration errors) which is likely to afford us the opportunity as a collaborative to build the right detection/reporting mechanism. \\

Lastly, please remember that these data are de-identified, though there may be examples where you`ll be able to infer which program identifier is associated with which program.  There are no formal data-sharing agreements in place, though it is the expectation that these data should be solely used for quality improvement of critical care transport  both locally and nationally.  Performance data should not be used for marketing one program versus another.\\
