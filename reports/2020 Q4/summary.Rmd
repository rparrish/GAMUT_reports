### Benchmark Summary 

This table shows your program's rolling 12 month rate vs. the overall GAMUT rate for each metric. 



```{r summary data, results = 'asis'}
insufficent_threshold <- 5

measure_overview <- data.frame()

excluded_measures <- c("TM-1", "TM-2a", "TM-2b") # time-based metrics

metric_summary_data <- filter(metric_data, !measure_id %in% excluded_measures)

for(i in metric_summary_data$measure_id) {
        
       mydata <- 
           measure_summary(i, program) %>%
           data.frame()
       
        
        measure_overview <- bind_rows(measure_overview, mydata)
}

# remove measures below the insufficient threshold

summary_table <- 
    metric_summary_data %>%
    left_join(measure_overview, by = "measure_id") %>%
    select(short_name, num, den, program_rate, gamut_rate, direction_higher, oe) 

kable(summary_table, format = "pipe",
      col.names = c("Metric Name", "Num", "Den", "Program", "GAMUT", "Desired", "OE"))

cat("\n")

```



 - NA:  "Not available" due to no data or < 5 cases in the denominator
 - Desired: Indicates the desired direction rate of a metric. (ie. "Higher is better", "Lower is better") 
 - OE: Program's (Observed) rate divided by the GAMUT (Expected) rate. An OE < 1 means the Observed rate is lower than Expected and an OE > 1 means the Observed rate is higher. An OE near 1 means the two rates are similar.
